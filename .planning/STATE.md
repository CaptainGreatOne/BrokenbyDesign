## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Docker over Kubernetes: Simpler to run locally, K8s is orchestration not observability
- Pre-built services over tutorials: Eliminates setup tax, learner focuses on observability
- Modular architecture: Allows starting small on limited resources, scaling up
- Standard stack first: Prometheus/Grafana/ELK are industry standards, interview-relevant

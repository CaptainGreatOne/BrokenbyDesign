# 🧪 Broken by Design (WIP)

> A hands-on learning environment for observability and CI/CD — where the systems already exist, and already misbehave.

⚠️ **Status: Under Construction**  
This project is actively evolving. Expect rough edges, incomplete lessons, and breaking changes.

---

## 🧩 Problem Being Solved

Learning observability and pipelines usually looks like this:

1. Build an application  
2. Set up infrastructure  
3. Configure databases  
4. Wire everything together  
5. Burn out  
6. *Maybe* learn observability

This project flips that model.

The applications already exist.  
They already misbehave — **intentionally**.

Instead of building features, you practice:
- Detecting failures
- Diagnosing root causes
- Understanding system behavior under stress

## 🎯 Target Learner

This project is designed for someone who:

- Has basic Docker familiarity
- Is comfortable reading code and configs
- Wants interview-ready confidence in:
  - Observability
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Debugging production-style systems

You do **not** need prior experience with:
- Production monitoring
- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing
- CI/CD workflow design

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- **Start guided**  
  Exercises explain the *why*, not just the *how*.

- **Move to diagnostics**  
  “Something is slow — find the bottleneck.”

- **Embrace realistic chaos**  
  Services break, degrade, return partial data, and recover imperfectly.

- **Progress modularly**  
  Each lesson may introduce new services, tools, or failure modes.

The goal is intuition — not memorization.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Practice (Planned)

- Interpreting logs that matter
- Reading metrics in context
- Tracing requests across services
- Catching regressions via CI
- Using pipelines as guardrails
- Explaining failures clearly and calmly

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- [ ] Project structure in progress
- [ ] Broken services being defined
- [ ] Initial guided exercises planned
- [ ] CI/CD workflows under design

Nothing here is stable yet — by design.

---

## 🚫 Non-Goals

- Not a Kubernetes tutorial
- Not a cloud cost simulator
- Not a polished course platform

This is a **lab**, not a product.
